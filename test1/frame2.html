<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p class=one>
As a 5-star MyQuest ranked private higher education institution approved by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, UCSI College provides quality education and learning support for professionally-driven, industry-ready academic programmes to equip students and the current workforce with the necessary skills and knowledge for career success and continuous professional development.

The higher education industry is moving towards education for employability, especially preparing students for the digitally advanced workforce. It is no longer merely preparing a student to obtain a certificate, a diploma, or a degree. It is strategically working with the industry to add value and to prepare the students for job-readiness upon graduation. Students with the relevant technical skills will have more opportunities for better job opportunities.

UCSI College started off as UCSI English Academy in 2007 providing English Language Proficiency programmes for UCSI University students. In 2012, the academy was accorded college status by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia and became UCSI Professional Academy. In April 2014 the college was renamed Lux International College and subsequently rebranded as UCSI College in December 2015.

Since 2016, UCSI College has been growing in recognition through partnerships and collaboration with professional bodies and international institutions. This includes the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) International Board, Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE), collaboration with universities in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, and Australia, an accredited TESOL center, and, of course, a strong affiliation with UCSI University, which is currently ranked 284th in the QS World Rankings 2023. UCSI College welcomes local and international students as part of its growing student body.
